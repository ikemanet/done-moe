简单易用的日常事务管理工具，让你在循环中养成好习惯。  
Simple and easy routine management app, build your habits in the Loop.

## Introduction 简介

小驴拉磨 (取效率的谐音，以及作者本人昵称老马的拼音首字母 -_-||| ，以及周而复始之意) 它可以帮你养成好习惯，让你在 Loop 中自律过好每一天！  
Uniloop (Inspired by the word Unicorn, which is the last name of the author, modified corn to loop)  
It helps you building your habits, self-control and enjoy your life.

- 每一个习惯的养成绝非一朝一夕，而是在一个 Loop (循环) 中周而复始的进行着。
- You can't build a habit in a day, only grow it repeatedly in the Loop.
  
- 因此我们设计了周期循环理念 —— Loop，每个 Loop 不需要在固定日期前完成，不让你有任何紧迫感，反而你会想要提前完成它们。
- Therefore, we designed the concept of circulation - we called it Loop. You don't have to complete it before a fixed date, so you will not have any sense of urgency. Instead, you will have the willing to complete them in advance.
  
- 同时每个 Loop 设有一个计时器及进度条，当快到期时，进度条也会随之变色，哪些应该优先完成一目了然。
- Addtionally, every Loop has a timer and a progress bar, it changes its color while the Loop is reaching to the due date, so you will have a clear view of the priority.
  
- 可以设置完成 Loop 所需的次数，完成相应次数后才能完成 Loop。例如每天喝7杯水，就可以设置需要完成7次。
- You can set actions of Loop, the Loop will be completed only if you have finished the specific times of action. For drinking 7 glasses of water as an example, the amount of action will be set to 7.
  
- Loop 完成后就会进入下一个循环，如果 Loop 已经提前完成，可以灵活安排下一个循环何时开始，给你喘息的机会！可以立即开始，可以在第二天0点开始，也可以在 Loop 原定到期时间之后后再开始。例如每周打扫卫生，可设置为完成后立即开始下一个循环，因为只要打扫一完成，屋内的清洁程度就会立即开始变化；而每周跟朋友联系，则可以设置为在原定到期时间之后再开始下一个循环，这样你只需要在7天内联系过朋友即可。
- Once a Loop is completed, it goes to the next cycle. If the Loop is completed in advance, you are able to schedule the starting point of the next cycle, in order to have a break! Could be immediately, could be at the 0:00 of the next day, or after the end of original due date. For room cleaning every week as an example, you could set it to restart immediately, because the cleanliness condition starts changing immediately after the cleaning. Another example of chatting with best friends, you could set it to restart after original due date, so that you will only need to chat once a week.
  
- 支持提醒功能，当 Loop 还有2小时到期时，你将收到通知推送
- Reminder is supported, at 2 hours before the Loop get expired, you will receive a notification.
  
- 支持统计功能，掌握习惯养成情况，让你可以一直坚持下去
- Statistics is supported, allows you to manage the status of your habits, makes you keep the persistence.
  
- 支持简体中文，英语，西班牙语，其他语言等待你贡献翻译
- Multi-language supported, it provides Simplified Chinese, English and Spanish. I'm waiting for you to contribute your translation.

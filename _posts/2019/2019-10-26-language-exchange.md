### Yes-no question
In Chinese you just simply add ``吗 ma`` in the end to transform a declarative sentence to ``yes-no question``. The answer is simply to use the verb in the question, ``要 yào`` (Yes, I want to) or ``不 bù`` + the verb. 
But in this case it's not very polite to directly say ``不要 bú yào``, in many cases ``不要 bú yào`` means ``do not do something``. So you could say ``不了 bù le`` no (for this time) or ``不用 bú yòng`` no (it's not necessary).  
{:.zhtips}
The tricky thing here is that in speaking Chinese, ``不`` actually pronounced ``bù`` (fourth tone), it means ``no`` and usually you can't use it lonely, but if it combines with a fourth-tone symbol behind it, itself changed to ``bú`` (second tone).
{:.zhtips}
```
不 要
bú yào
Do not (do this) / (I) don't want.
```
<p class="zhcn">/assets/le-sound/zh-cn/want/dont-want.aac</p>
```
不 好
bù hǎo
No / It's not good
```

Here ``呢 ne`` does not have actual meaning, but with this ``呢 ne`` will sound kinder and closer to another side. Also it has a feeling express that you really want to know the answer. You can use ``呢 ne`` in the end of Wh-questions.
